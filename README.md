### Final project of the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" 
#### Coursera, Data Science Specialization



Purpose of this project:

collect, work with, clean a data set in a way that is useful for later analysis.



In this repository, you will find:
- **README.md**, explaining the files in this repository and how they are connected;
- **CodeBook.md**, explaining the dataset and the variables, and how the raw data has been cleaned up with **run_analysis.R**;
- **run_analysis.R**, the script for performing the "preprocessing" analysis.


Important: I suggest to go through the files in this repo according to the order listed above.
